I'm Axel, a Computer Scientist passionate about making useful things for fellow humans. My interests have ranged from cleaning ocean plastic pollution 🌊, to countering fake news and polarization online ✌, and building 🤖 general-purpose robots using embodied AI.

I use different technological skills for these projects, ranging from pure maths and graph theory, to full-stack software development, Machine Learning, High-Performance Computing and UI/UX design.

## Current and previous public projects

- 🤖 - The coolest project I've ever worked on

- 🕰️🧠 &nbsp; [Timescribe](https://timescribe.org) - An AI-based productivity app that watches your activity during the day to give you reports and help you work better. Running completely locally for guaranteed privacy.

- 👨‍💻👥 &nbsp; [OpenArchitect](https://github.com/OpenArchitectAI/open-architect) - Develop software 10x faster by spawning an army of AI software engineers to code in your repo, work togetherm, while you supervise their work.

- 🖼️🤖 &nbsp; [NaturalFrontend](https://github.com/axelpey/natural-frontend) - A one-liner to have your FastAPI backend generate frontend code automatically for different kinds of users you might have. The agent understands everything about your code and does it for you!

- ✈️🌎 &nbsp; [TravelGPT.green](https://www.travelgpt.green) - A website using multiple generative AIs to make creative sustainable traveling ideas as alternatives for users plans, in order to make them emit less CO2 for travel.

- ✌️ &nbsp; [Along - getalong.io](https://getalong.io) - A plugin comment system for websites based on annotations, designed to provide a healthier, anti-polarization experience for you and your readers. Deployed on [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com) & [The Salt Lake Tribune](https://sltrib.com) - total 6.5M+ readers monthly.

- 🧠⌚️ &nbsp; [Friend](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Friend) - An open-source, super-affordable AI wearable that listens to what you say during the day, transcribes it and allows many use-cases based on it. Built at the SF Mistral AI Hackathon 2024.

- 🌊🌎 &nbsp; [The Ocean Cleanup Plastic Tracker](https://theoceancleanup.com/plastic-tracker/) - A web-app using my research at The Ocean Cleanup to show you where your plastic might end up in the ocean when you abandon it on land. To date, more than 150k + users.

- ⚙️🌎 &nbsp; [Ocean Plastic Assimilator](https://github.com/TheOceanCleanupAlgorithms/Ocean-Plastic-Assimilator) - A data assimilation algorithm for ocean plastic lagrangian dispersion models.
